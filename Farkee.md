Farkee is a Farcaster MiniApp-based marketplace that allows high-influence Farcaster Handles to monetize their channel by selling the right to post a single cast on their feed. This is achieved by creating different Farkee Commission NFTs (e.g., "Roast Me Slot" or "Token Shill"), each with a predefined price and content policy. When a buyer purchases a Commission NFT on Celo, they submit their desired cast text through the MiniApp, which is then sent to an Oasis ROFL TEE for secure, tamper-proof policy validation (e.g., checking for specific keywords or adhering to the chosen contract type). If the policy passes, the TEE securely generates the Farcaster signer signature on behalf of the Handle, publishes the cast, and atomically burns the Commission NFT, ensuring the Handle maintains full security, earns instant revenue, and guarantees a strict one-cast-per-commission execution.
